# car_dealership
Learning, SQL
I started off with invewntory being the first table because if we don't have it in out inventorty than we can't sell it it would slows us down. I also had the mechanic, customer, and sales person at the end because they complete the sale or service request and the customer and the customer just takes his car home so it's molre efficient this way.
